  Oliver White Resume
</h1>
<h2>Gatsby Version</h2>

This is the repository containing the Gatsby version of my resume website. So far I have built three versions of my resume and linktree page:

- [GatsbyJS](https://gatsby.oliverwhite.ca)
- [Remix](https://remix.oliverwhite.ca)
- [NextJS](https://next.oliverwhite.ca)

The principal reason for these versions is to test out the capabilities of these frameworks and put them through their paces.

One of these versions is also present at https://oliverwhite.ca.

## ðŸš€ Development

1.  **Clone this repository.**

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/oliverwhite19/resume-gatsby.git
    ```

2.  **Add your env variables**
    Navigate into the sites directory and create an environment file

    ```shell
    cd resume-gatsby
    touch .env.development
    ```

    This is a template for that environment file

    ```
    DATABASE_URL=''
    DATABASE_NAME=''
    ```

3.  **Start developing.**
    Install packages and launch the site

    ```shell
    yarn
    yarn develop
    ```
